# Predicting-wine-quality

As the weather warms up, you may find yourself walking into a wine shop and instinctively grabbing for a tall, thin bottle, tinted green and sealed with a screw top, anticipating the satisfaction of the light, bubbly, crisp white wine known as Vinho Verde. (Do you?)

On a summer afternoon, it’s really the perfect drink, and can take you into the evening by becoming a fantastic dinner wine. Although Vinho Verde’s popularity in the last decade has surged, there are a lot of misconceptions out there about this affordable and versatile wine. In fact, there’s far more to Vinho Verde than a little spritz—and Portuguese wine culture in general is full of history and intrigue. Surprise your friends at the next barbeque by serving them some knowledge about Vinho Verde as you fill their glasses with the wine.

“VINHO VERDE” IS NOT A GRAPE, OR A BLEND: IT’S A REGION
In the lush, green, rolling hills of northern Portugal, dotted with the orange rooftops of family households, is the region where Vinho Verde wine is produced. Although there are several origin stories behind its name, including the idea that it is harvested early and should be drunk young, many people in the region suggest that the name comes from the verdant natural setting.

Comprised of nine sub-regions in the Douro Valley, each with unique micro-climates but generally dominated by granitic soils, the Vinho Verde wine region starts just below the Portuguese-Spanish border, and extends all the way to the Atlantic Ocean, where it meets with the city of Port (where most Port wine is made). The region is also fairly wet and rainy, as two rivers run through it, the Douro and Minho.

Data Set Information:

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
